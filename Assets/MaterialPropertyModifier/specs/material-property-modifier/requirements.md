# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a Unity editor tool that allows developers to efficiently find all materials in a selected folder that use a specific shader, and then modify a named property (such as _Metallic) to a target value. This tool will streamline the process of bulk material property updates during development and asset optimization workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want to select a folder in the Project window and specify a shader name, so that I can find all materials using that shader within the selected folder and its subfolders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a folder in the Project window THEN the tool SHALL scan that folder and all subfolders for materials
2. WHEN the user specifies a shader name THEN the tool SHALL filter materials to only those using the specified shader
3. WHEN no materials are found with the specified shader THEN the tool SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no matches were found
4. WHEN materials are found THEN the tool SHALL display a list of all matching materials with their file paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want to specify a material property name and target value, so that I can modify that property across multiple materials simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a property name THEN the tool SHALL validate that the property exists on the selected shader
2. WHEN the user enters a target value THEN the tool SHALL validate that the value is appropriate for the property type (float, color, texture, etc.)
3. WHEN the user confirms the modification THEN the tool SHALL update the specified property on all found materials to the target value
4. WHEN a material doesn't have the specified property THEN the tool SHALL skip that material and log a warning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want to preview the changes before applying them, so that I can verify the modifications are correct before committing to them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN materials are found and property details are specified THEN the tool SHALL display a preview showing current and target values
2. WHEN the user reviews the preview THEN the tool SHALL show which materials will be modified and which will be skipped
3. WHEN the user confirms the changes THEN the tool SHALL apply all modifications and mark assets as dirty for saving
4. WHEN the user cancels the operation THEN the tool SHALL make no changes to any materials

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want the tool to be accessible through Unity's editor interface, so that I can easily access it during my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is installed THEN it SHALL be accessible through Unity's Tools menu
2. WHEN the tool window is opened THEN it SHALL display an intuitive interface with clear labels and controls
3. WHEN the user interacts with the tool THEN it SHALL provide immediate feedback and validation
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the tool SHALL display success/failure messages with details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Unity developer, I want the tool to handle errors gracefully, so that my project remains stable even if issues occur during material modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during material scanning THEN the tool SHALL log the error and continue processing other materials
2. WHEN a material file is locked or read-only THEN the tool SHALL skip that material and report the issue
3. WHEN invalid property names or values are provided THEN the tool SHALL display clear error messages before attempting modifications
4. WHEN the operation is interrupted THEN the tool SHALL ensure no materials are left in an inconsistent state
